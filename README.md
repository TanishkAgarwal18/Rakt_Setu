Rakt Setu is a web-based platform designed to bridge the critical gap between blood donors and recipients. This project aims to create a seamless and efficient network , allowing users to register as donors and used in blood donation campaigns. By leveraging technology, Rakt Setu facilitates faster communication and coordination, ultimately helping to save lives.

## About The Project

**Rakt Setu** is a digital initiative to tackle the challenge of blood shortages. Our platform serves as a centralized, real-time directory of voluntary blood donors. The primary goal is to ensure that anyone in urgent need of blood can find a donor of the required blood group in their vicinity with minimal delay.

### Key Objectives:

* **Simplify:** To provide an easy-to-use interface for both donors registering and for users searching for blood.
* **Accelerate:** To reduce the time it takes to find a blood donor during emergencies.
* **Inspire:** To raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and encourage more people to become life-savers.
